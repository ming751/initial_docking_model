# mujoco dynamics docking (sdf version)

Welcome to the mujodo dynamics docking (sdf version) repository! 

This project is designed to provide a comprehensive solution for trajectory planning and dynamics simulation in robotics using the Mujoco simulator. It's built on top of the powerful Pinocchio library, which allows for efficient forward kinematics calculations.

## Introduction
This is a repository for mujoco dynamics simulation and compliance control.

## Features

- signed distance field (sdf)
- dynamics simulation
- compliance control

## Instruction
### 1. Model Files
1. iiwa14_dock.xml is an iiwa model with sdf linked at the end;
2. iiwa14_dock.urdf is the urdf version of iiwa14_dock.xml, used for pin's dynamics calculation;

### 2. Core Scripts
1. dynamics.py - Used to verify the dynamics of pin and mujoco
2. Relate_class.py - Contains related classes for the simulation,trajectory planning,inverse kinematics,dynamics control,etc;
3. task_dynamics_mujoco_control.py - Main simulation script for running the dynamics control

## Usage

To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ming751/initial_docking_model.git
   ```

   ```bash
   cd initial_docking_model
   ```

2. Install the dependencies(if you use dymamic simulation, you need to install pinocchio,pinocchio must be installed in linux system):

   1) create an conda environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   conda create -n pin_mjcf python=3.10
   conda activate pin_mjcf
   ```
   
   2) install the pinocchio dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pin
   ```
   
   3) install other dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirement.txt
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ### Main simulation script

   ```bash
   python task_dynamics_mujoco_control.py
   ```
